# RP Universe - Minecraft Role-Playing Control Plugin
## Introduction
RP Universe is a revolutionary Minecraft plugin, designed to control an entire game server and bring the concept of role-playing (RP) into the world of Minecraft. Given the growing interest in RP in games, this plugin represents not only a challenge at the national level but also globally.

## Description
### Overview:
RP Universe boasts the ability to control almost every game aspect, from movement to communication. Communication between players will be mediated by voice chat, but the plugin itself will not contain voice chat. Instead, it will add functional commands like /me, /do, /status, and /here, which allow players to express their emotions, activities, and statuses. The job system will be fully configurable in-game and will provide moderators with the ability to create and edit jobs for players.

For voice chat communication, I recommend the [OpenAudioMc](https://github.com/Mindgamesnl/OpenAudioMc) project.

### Data Storage:
Server owners will have the flexibility in configuring how and where to store data - locally (for example, in JSON format) or in a database.

For Developers, there is an option to make an addon adding data storage options.

### Integration and API:
A quality API is a matter of course so that developers can customize and extend the plugin. In addition, integration with the popular scripting plugin for Minecraft, Skript, is planned.

### Additional Features:
- Player Jobs
  - Jobs can be created and edited directly in the game without the need to edit configs / database.
- System to control player interactions with the plugin
  - The system will check payments and all interactions that have taken place and if it finds any discrepancies or possible dupe (Whether monetary or material) it will try to report it.
  - This system can be turned off in the config, it is possible that it would incorrectly detect discrepancies in connection with certain plugins.
- Needs
- Billing system
  - Players can send invoices to other players or companies.
- Payments between players
- Property purchase
- Comprehensive banking system
- Localization system
