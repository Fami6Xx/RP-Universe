 * Integration tests for the invoice system.
 * 
 * These tests verify that the invoice system integrates correctly with other systems:
 * - Job system
 * - Economy system
 * - Menu API
 * - Language system
 * 
 * Note: This is a simplified demonstration of how integration tests would be structured.
 * In a real implementation, these tests would use proper mocking and assertions.

        // This test would verify that the invoice system integrates correctly with the job system
        // It would test:
        // 1. Job membership verification
        // 2. Special privileges for job bosses
        // 3. Job-specific invoice filtering
        
        // Example test steps:
        // 1. Mock the job system components
        // 2. Create an invoice as a job boss
        // 3. Verify the invoice was created successfully
        // 4. Test that non-job members cannot create invoices for that job
        // 5. Test that job-specific filtering works correctly

        // This test would verify that the invoice system integrates correctly with the economy system
        // It would test:
        // 1. Balance checking
        // 2. Money transfer functionality
        // 3. Transaction logging
        
        // Example test steps:
        // 1. Mock the economy system components
        // 2. Create an invoice
        // 3. Test paying the invoice with sufficient funds
        // 4. Verify the money was transferred correctly
        // 5. Test paying the invoice with insufficient funds
        // 6. Verify the payment fails and no money is transferred

    @Test
    public void testMenuAPIIntegration() {
        // This test would verify that the invoice system integrates correctly with the menu API
        // It would test:
        // 1. Proper use of EasyPaginatedMenu
        // 2. Menu navigation
        // 3. Action handling
        
        // Example test steps:
        // 1. Mock the menu API components
        // 2. Create multiple invoices
        // 3. Open the invoice menu
        // 4. Verify that pagination works correctly
        // 5. Test menu navigation
        // 6. Test action buttons (pay, delete)

        // This test would verify that the invoice system integrates correctly with the language system
        // It would test:
        // 1. Message retrieval
        // 2. Placeholder support
        // 3. Language initialization
        
        // Example test steps:
        // 1. Mock the language system components
        // 2. Create an invoice
        // 3. Test notification messages
        // 4. Verify that placeholders are replaced correctly
        // 5. Test different language configurations
